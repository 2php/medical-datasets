# List of Medical Datasets
I maintain this list mostly as a personal braindump of interesting medical datasets, with a focus on medical imaging.   
Rather than try to group / cluster datasets, I'm going to try to maintain a set of keywords for each.

**Disclaimer**: please remember to solve real clinical problems â˜º
